      <p className="text-gray font-sans text-sm xl:text-base text-justify leading-relaxed">I graduated with a bachelor's degree in information system from  
        <span className="text-blue"> Sekolah Tinggi Teknologi Terpadu Nurul Fikri</span> in March 2023, where I gained experience
        in various programming languages and tools, with a focus on frontend development. During my studies, I completed several 
        projects using React, including a responsive e-commerce website. I also developed a custom content management system for a 
        client using Laravel. I am passionate about learning and growing in the field of frontend development, and I am constantly 
        seeking out new challenges and opportunities to expand my skills. I have a particular interest in React, and I have completed 
        multiple certifications and courses related to this framework. I also have skills in Figma, a software for designing user interfaces, 
        and SQL, a language for managing databases.
